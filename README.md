# Sample Website

This is a nice tutorial although it has a staggering and frustrating lack of depth
with loads of bad habits but it encouraged me to pick up git again so i will
let the self promotion slide!

This is a sample website made as part of [*Learn Enough™ Git to Be
Dangerous*](http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial), possibly the greatest
beginner Git tutorial in the history of the Universe. You should totally [
check it out](http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial), and be sure to [join
the email list](http://learnenough.com/#email_list) and [follow @learnenough
](http://twitter.com/learnenough) on Twitter.

After finishing *Learn Enough™ Git to Be Dangerous*, you'll know enough Git
to be *dangerous*. This means you'll be able to use Git to track changes in
your projects, back up data, share your work with others, and collaborate
with programmers and other users of Git.
